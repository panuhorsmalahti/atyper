   Open your terminal and navigate to the `backend` folder of the project.

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   If you haven't already installed the dependencies, run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Server:**

   Start the server by running:

   npm run start
   ```

   The server should now be running.

## Starting the CLI

1. **Navigate to the CLI Folder:**

   Open a new terminal window or tab and navigate to the `frontends/cli` folder of the project.

   ```bash
   cd frontends/cli
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
